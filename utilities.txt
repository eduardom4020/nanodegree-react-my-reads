Git utils, by Eduardo Melo:

PS: DO NOT CHANGE README FILE IN BRANCHS THAT ARE NOT develop OR master

Merge commit messages:
    -> When some job is in progress:
        DOING: <report current status progress>, if needed add an TODO tag and describe what will be done on next commit.
        ex: DOING: Describing my git practices. TODO: Finish this description.
    -> When job is done:
        DONE: <report what was done>
        ex: DONE: Finished my git practices description
    -> When merging a branch:
        MERGE: merged with <branch name> branch and logged it in README.md
        ps: allways add modification log to README when merging. That's no need for do this
        on working branch, leave this to be done only when merges that branch to develop or
        develop to master.
